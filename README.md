## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This is the assignment lab of the course ECE 5010 Software Design. This assignment was done in the second week of class in my 5th term as a computer engineering student. This assignment uses object oriented programming concepts in Java. The IDE that was used was Eclipse and I suggest that you use Eclipse as well to pull this project down. 

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need Eclipse for your IDE
You will also need the latest JAVA JDK
